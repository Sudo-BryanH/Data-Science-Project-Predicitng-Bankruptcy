## Introduction
For our ECON 323 Quantitative Economic Modelling with Data Science Applications course, our team has written a project which takes in a set of data on bankrupt firms, create a classification model on it, and try to predict the Silicon Valley Bank Bankruptcy using the company's data prior to collapsing. The project Jupyter file contains the full report.
